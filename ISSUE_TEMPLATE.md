[Decentralized Serverless Apps]
[Blockstack.org (https://blockstack.org/) is building a decentralized internet so JS developers can build decentralized serverless applications. We would love to have Larry Salibra do a refined presentation and probably a hands-on tutorial/onboarding segment for the JS community at London Node.js. He is available December 1st, however please let us know if you have an earlier date in mind. He can prepare a 20 minute talk or one that ranges anywhere from 15-60 minutes. Some examples of talks from our founders we've done in the past listed below:
